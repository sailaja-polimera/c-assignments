1) why the character is 1 byte?

   Explanation:
   Just count all the values, so total will 26 capital alphabets we have in English and 26 small letters 
   next 10 numbers and not more than 150 special symbols. So here if you add all these, then this is less than 256. 
   Any language you can take in this world, it is at most having 256 symbols.
   So, ASCII decided that if we assign the values for these symbols from 0 to 255, so you 
   can represent any character in the language using one byte of memory.
   256 is nothing but a 2 power 8 value. 2 power 8 is nothing but a one-byte memory.
   This is the only reason every character we can represent using one byte of memory in a programming language.
  
  
  
 2) What does CHAR (UNnsigned &  Signed) by default?

  explanation:
  By default, char behaves like an unsigned char .
  The default value of Char is the character with a code point of 0.

 About character datatype:


 3)/*character data type --->  signed and unsigned   

Char is the most basic data type in C. It stores a single character and requires a single byte of memory in almost all compilers.
Unsigned char is a character datatype where the variable consumes all the 8 bits of the memory and there is no sign bit (which is there in signed char). 
So it means that the range of unsigned char data type ranges from 0 to 255.
Syntax: unsigned char [variable_name] = [value]
The range for signed  char data type ranges from -128 to +127
Syntax: unsigned char [variable_name] = [value]
Either positive value or negative value always the counting starts with 0.Positive value counting starts from 0, 1, 2, and so on up to 127  in a clockwise direction.
Negative values counting starts from -1, -2, -3, and so in up to -128 in an anti-clockwise direction .
Note: In the declaration of variable if you are not specifying whether the variable is a signed variable or unsigned variable by default it is a signed variable and can accept both positive and negative values.
let us explain with program
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{   unsigned char ch1 = 'c';//initialisation of unsigned char
    unsigned char ch2 = 258;//initialisation of unsigned char(its a warning becoz it is out of range)
    char ch3;//declaration of char data type(defaultly it takes signed )
    char CH = 'A';//initialisation of signed char (defaultly it takes signed )
    signed char ch4 = 126;//initialisation of signed char
    signed char ch5 = 260;//initialisation of signed char
    
    
    printf("%c\n", CH);//printing character
    printf("%d\n", CH);// printing integer value of the character
    printf("%c\n", ch1);//for signed printing character
    printf("%d\n", ch1);//for signed printing value of character
    printf("%c\n", ch2);// unknown garbage value may print becoz out of unsigned range
    printf("%d\n", ch2);//it print '2'depends on number chat
    printf("enter one character: ");//our console is to enter the character
    scanf("%c",&ch3);// read the entered character
    printf("ASCII value is %d\n",ch3);//display ASCII  value for character
    printf("%c\n", ch4);//printing character for no. signed 126
    printf("%d\n", ch4);// print the signed value
    printf("%c\n", ch5);//unknown garbage value may print becoz out of unsigned range
    printf("%d\n", ch5);// for 260 it will give 4 as interger value depends on number chat
    return 0;
}
output:
A
65
c
99
garbage value
2
enter one character: %
ASCII value is 37
~
126
garbage value
4
